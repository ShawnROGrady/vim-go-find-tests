1. INTRO                                                 *go-find-tests-intro*

Provides utilities for finding and navigating test functions for the go
programming language. 

NOTE: this plugin is still in beta, so backwards incompatible changes may be
made prior to v1.0.0

==============================================================================
2. REQUIREMENTS                                           *go-find-tests-reqs*

Have the go-find-tests binary (https://github.com/ShawnROGrady/go-find-tests)
installed.

NOTE: the go-find-tests tool is currently in beta, partially because I want to
ensure the API is friendly to developing editor plugins like this. As such
backwards incompatible changes may be made prior to v1.0.0 so make sure
the version of the binary you've installed matches the requirement.

3. COMMANDS                                               *go-find-tests-cmds*

                                                                *:GoFindTests*
:GoFindTests [args]                                                                    
        Populates quickfix list with tests covering the block of code under
        the cursor. Jumps to first covering test if any found.
        Next test can be accessed with `:cn`, previous test can be reached
        with `:cp`. See `:quickfix`  for more information about navigating
        the quickfix list
        
        All [args] are passed directly to the go-find-tests tool EXCEPT
        '-json' and '-line-fmt regexp' since these would interfere with the
        parsing of the output. For a full list of available [args] run
        'go-find-tests -h'

                                                            *:GoCoveringTests*
:GoCoveringTests [args]                                                         
        Prints the names of the tests covering the position under the cursor.
        Similar to just calling `:!go-find-tests` but handles setting
        positional args
        
        All [args] are passed directly to the go-find-tests tool. For a full
        list of available [args] run 'go-find-tests -h'.
